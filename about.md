I'd describe myself as a generalist, with experience in technology, education and product. A jack of all trades and a master of some. 

I'm currently working in scholarly comms leading the product function for [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/) and [Sciety](https://sciety.org) as part of [eLife](https://elifesciences.org). Previous to that I was in ed. tech; heading up the customer support function at [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/), learning tech. at [Falmouth Uni](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/) (where I picked up an MA (Hons) Education) and teaching music tech. at [DMU](https://dmu.ac.uk) and [Warwickshire College](https://wcg.ac.uk/) where I studied Adult Learning.

I'm really enjoying the world of Product Management and love talking to fellow PMs about creating joyful, open and equitable experiences.

I work from home in South Devon, living here with my partner and our beagle and have ended up here via stints in the New Forest, Cornwall and Leicester (where I grew up).

Outside of work, I like anything to do with plants and water.
