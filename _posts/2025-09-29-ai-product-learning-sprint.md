I'm starting a new role in a few weeks and in the interim I wanted  to structure some learning around product and AI alongside making  some time for gardening and learning the piano. I asked Claude to  generate a plan that I can follow and this is what it provided. I expect to loosely follow the approach and document it here on the blog.

### Week 1: AI Foundations & PM Fundamentals
Learning Focus: Understanding the AI product landscape and current best practices
Hands-on Projects:

**Days 1-2:** Build a simple chatbot using Claude API or OpenAI API. Create a basic use case (customer support, content assistant, etc.) to understand prompting, API integration, and user experience considerations
**Day 3:** Explore prompt engineering - create a prompt library for different use cases and document what works/doesn't work
**Day 4:** Study and document 3 AI products you admire. Analyze their product strategy, user flows, and monetization
**Day 5:** Create a mini PRD (Product Requirements Document) for an AI feature you'd add to an existing product

Resources to explore:

Anthropic's Claude documentation and prompt engineering guide
Lenny's Newsletter recent AI PM content
Try multiple AI tools hands-on (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor)

### Week 2: AI Product Development & Metrics
Learning Focus: Building, measuring, and iterating AI products
Hands-on Projects:

**Day 1:** Design and prototype an AI feature using Figma or similar tool. Focus on the user journey and edge cases
**Day 2:** Learn about RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - build a simple document Q&A system using your own documents
**Day 3:** Create a metrics framework for an AI product. Define success metrics, quality metrics, and guardrails
**Day 4:** Conduct "user **research" by testing your Week 1 chatbot with 3-5 people. Document feedback and iterate
**Day 5:** Write a one-pager on AI product strategy for a domain you're interested in

Key concepts to study:

LLM evaluation and testing
Responsible AI and safety considerations
Token economics and cost optimization
AI product-market fit indicators

### Week 3: Advanced Topics & Portfolio Preparation
Learning Focus: Emerging trends and synthesizing your learning
Hands-on Projects:

**Day 1:** Explore AI agents - build a simple multi-step agent that can perform a task (research assistant, data analyzer)
**Day 2:** Study multimodal AI - experiment with image/document analysis APIs
**Day 3:** Create a competitive analysis of AI products in a specific vertical (healthcare, education, legal, etc.)
**Day 4:** Develop a pitch deck for an AI product idea, including market analysis, user personas, and roadmap
**Day 5:** Consolidate your learning - write a reflection document and update your LinkedIn/portfolio with your projects
