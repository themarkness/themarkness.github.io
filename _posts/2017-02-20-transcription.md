Today I finished the last transcription of my interviews and focus group. It was hard and robotic work and I can see why people make use of things like [fiverr](fiverr.com) to get people to do it for them. I tried using [Google Docs voice to text](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en) facility too, but it only really works if you're sat in front of the device talking.

Nevertheless, I have 28'000 words of inspired feedback from students across the two subject areas that I am studying. What is useful about the process of doing it yourself, is that you hear the inflections in the voice and how the participant is framing the speech. You also get a sense of emerging and interrelating themes.

I now move on to the coding and analysis phase. My research is going to test out some of the statements provided by the [JISC/NUS Digital Benchmarking tool](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6140/1/Jisc_NUS_student_experience_benchmarking_tool.pdf)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Frepository.jisc.ac.uk%2F6140%2F1%2FJisc_NUS_student_experience_benchmarking_tool.pdf&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file") that arose from the initial JISC Digital Experience tracker and how they apply within creative Higher Education, specifically at Falmouth University.
