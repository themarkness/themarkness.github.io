I've been finalising the MoU for the [Sciety X NLnet project](https://nlnet.nl/project/Sciety-ActivityPub/). Once this is agreed it means that myself and other named people can start work on the project. 

I ported a bug priorisation matrix (severityXpriority) from Sciety to Kotahi, as there are a bunch of bugs that we could move into differnet quadrants of the matrix. I'll write more about that as another post.

I setup a new gmail account and used [improvMX](https://improvmx.com) to set it up to send and recieve for markalexanderwilliams.co.uk. It was really simple to do, so if you have a domain you'd like to send email from.. I reckon it would be a good approach.

I got a knock back on one job (I have the right background in teaching and learning, but not the right fit for the product team they wanted to form). As one door closes, another opens, I have an interview request for another role next week. I took a day off work this week to apply for more roles.


Really nice meetings this week with folk at [astromat](https://astromat.org/),[ MetaROR](https://metaror.org/), [Gigascience](https://www.gigasciencepress.org/)and [Elise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-bateman-73130066/) at eLife. The latter to talk about community involvement in the NLnet project.
