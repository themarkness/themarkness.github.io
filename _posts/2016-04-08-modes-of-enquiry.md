Having set out my research proposal, I'm now thinking of shifting the 'focus' from focus groups to questionnaires. There exist two great surveys in the field already from [UCISA(http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/tel) and [ECAR](http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/2014-student-and-faculty-technology-research-studies), but in the UK we also have the [JISC/NUSBenchmarking Tool](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6140/1/Jisc_NUS_student_experience_benchmarking_tool.pdf), which promotes good practice regarding 'digital capability'.

I'm thinking that by switching methods, the semi-structured survey will hopefully inform the focus group and or interviews. This line of thought reminded my of [Leech and Onwuegbuzie's (2009)](http://download.springer.com/assets/pdf/567/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11135-007-9105-3.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11135-007-9105-3&token2=exp=1452023821~acl=%2Fassets%2Fpdf%2F567%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11135-007-9105-3.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11135-007-9105-3*~hmac=386a256c1db8d10626b58adccc23b976449131f0977d1a3d241cea23a3d5daed) mixed methods typology and I think that my MA will eventually be of "Partially Mixed Concurrent Equal Status Design". This in effect means that the focus groups and surveys will have qualitative and quantitive elements and nether will be afforded priority.
