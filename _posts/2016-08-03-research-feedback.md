I've now received initial feedback on my [research proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wm93JbaeT_QREJJaxCdvQqXaHiiXJ5ihIAhBJ4aI3TM/edit#heading=h.lgpe764hzwlv) and the key things that stand out are backing up examples and using proper Harvard referencing... seems RefMe can't do everything for me. It reminds my of GCSE History and the need to distinguish Primary and Secondary evidence.

I also need to add a couple more appendices of example surveys. The essay actually came back looking like it had been through a mangle, but I'm hoping that it's becuase it's been well thumbed through by my tutor.

As I mostly work in Google Docs, I added the notes to my document to follow up on and that will help me reflect on the feedback.
