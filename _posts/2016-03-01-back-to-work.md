It's 2016 already and I've lifted the lid on [the research proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wm93JbaeT_QREJJaxCdvQqXaHiiXJ5ihIAhBJ4aI3TM/edit?usp=sharing) again. I've revisited some of the [text](https://d167tapqdyj68f.cloudfront.net/markawilliams.withknown.com/f/3/4/2/f342b47e9f9f9ef2f9b4dd5bbc6cdafd.file)s to code and pick out key themes. I'm really getting in to http://refme.com for adding quotes and annotations, you can highlight text off the web and annotate your citations in browser, which is definitely how easy it should be to conduct research.


I've also been looking at alternate perspectives and am looking forward to reading Tara Brabazon's [The University of Google](http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754670971) which argues that a fetish for information and a lack of critical understanding is damaging Higher Education.

Proposal is due in in 2 days, so better get back to it!
