I've contributed to a range of open infrastructure and education-focused projects, helping shape product direction, improve user experience, and build communities of practice:

- [**Sciety**](https://sciety.org/) – Advancing trust and transparency in preprint peer review by connecting communities and surfacing curation signals.

- [**Kotahi**](https://kotahi.community/) – Supporting scholar-led publishing through an open-source peer review and publishing platform.

- [**NLnet Open Science flavour of Bonfire for preprints**](https://nlnet.nl/project/Sciety-ActivityPub/) – Exploring federated social tools to support knowledge sharing around preprints.

- [**micro:bit**](https://microbit.org/) – Enabling digital skills education through hardware and software tools for teachers, students, and developers worldwide.
