I've contributed to a range of open infrastructure and education-focused projects, helping shape product direction, improve user experience, and build communities of practice:

- [**Sciety**](https://sciety.org/) – Advancing trust and transparency in preprint peer review by connecting communities and surfacing curation signals. Sciety was my first official PM role and I was able to shape the role and the processes we used as a team, and explore a range of frameworks and methodologies. It couldn't have been  better as a place to develop product practice.

- [**Kotahi**](https://kotahi.community/) – Supporting scholar-led publishing through an open-source peer review and publishing platform. Currently Product Manager. I've instilled outcome based roadmapping and lean product practices within the team and I get to speak with clients on a weekly basis, which is one of my favourite things about working in product.

- [**NLnet Open Science flavour of Bonfire for preprints**](https://nlnet.nl/project/Sciety-ActivityPub/) – Exploring federated social tools to support knowledge sharing around preprints. I'm currently working as an independent product consultant to bring open science to the fediverse. I'm a long time supporter of open, democratised, decentralised technlogies to support communities, so this is a great opportunity to work with some great tech (Bonfire) and some great people.

- [**micro:bit**](https://microbit.org/) – Enabling digital skills education through hardware and software tools for teachers, students, and developers worldwide. Check out my [git history as microbit-mark](https://github.com/microbit-mark?tab=overview&from=2020-12-01&to=2020-12-31) between 2017-2020. I'm still working with micro:bits today, combing my passions of technology and adult education.

I've also made contributions to Wordpress and a range of other open source tech.
